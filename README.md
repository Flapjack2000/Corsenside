This repository serves as the home for all of my **math related programming projects** as I study **computer science** and **mathematics**.


### **_Why call it Corsenside?_**

It's a reference to **William Shanks**, an English mathematician born in 1812 in **Corsenside**, Northumberland.

He is regarded for his **calculations of Ï€** and **several other mathematical constants**, and he published a **table of primes and the periods of their reciprocals**, the latter of which inspired me to create **graph_num_factors.py**.
