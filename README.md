# Corsenside

### _Where am I?_

This repository serves as the home for all of my **math related programming projects** as I study **computer science** and **mathematics**.

These will include `Python` representations of **algorithms**, my **solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems**, and anything else I find interesting.

### _Why call it Corsenside?_

It's a reference to **[William Shanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shanks)**, an English mathematician born in 1812 in **Corsenside**, Northumberland.

He is regarded for his **calculations of Ï€** and several other **mathematical constants**, and he published a **table of primes and the periods of their reciprocals**, which served as inspiration for me to create **[graph_num_factors.py](https://github.com/Flapjack2000/Corsenside/blob/main/graph_num_factors)**.
